    <p class="backtext">Hi I'm Paul. I'm 23 and originally from the borders of South-East London and Kent and having finished my studies at Surrey University for my Computer Science and Engineering degree I'm working for ProspectSoft Ltd.</p>
	
    <p class="backtext"><br/><span class="subtitle">May 2010 - Setting up my new site</span><br/>
    Now that <a href="http://www.picklesplaycare.co.uk" onclick="target='_blank'" onkeypress="target='_blank'">www.PicklesPlaycare.co.uk</a> is done and dusted I'm putting together my new site. See you soon :)</p>
	
	<p class="backtext"><br/><span class="subtitle">September 09 - Pickles Playcare</span><br/>
    My new site has been put on hold while I've been working on <a href="http://www.picklesplaycare.co.uk" onclick="target='_blank'" onkeypress="target='_blank'">www.PicklesPlaycare.co.uk</a> for a friend</p>
		
	<p class="backtext"><br/><span class="subtitle">May 09 - Project Work</span><br/>
    Been busy at work - <a href="http://skippyroo.awardspace.com" onclick="target='_blank'" onkeypress="target='_blank'">better site</a> on its way however. Be patient!</p>
	
    <p class="backtext"><br/><span class="subtitle">March 09 - Project Work</span><br/>
    Thought I'd update my site - there you go :)</p>
	
    <p class="backtext"><br/><span class="subtitle">January 09 - Project Work</span><br/>
    So far, I've been working on an 80k project, getting my own ideas into the ProspectSoft CRM database and finding other things to do than work :)</p>
	
    <p class="backtext"><br/><span class="subtitle">September to December 08 - Work</span><br/>
    Now that I'm working full-time these months just blurred together :(</p>
	
    <p class="backtext"><br/><span class="subtitle">August 08 - Nothing</span><br/>
    As well as working I've also been developing my Resource Manager application</p>
	
    <p class="backtext"><br/><span class="subtitle">July 08 - Back at work</span><br/>
    I've not done a lot this month since I've started back at work.</p>
	
    <p class="backtext"><br/><span class="subtitle">June 08 - Time flies...</span><br/>
    Most of June was spent sitting on my bum. But I did find and move into a great flat in High Wycombe</p>
	
    <p class="backtext"><br/><span class="subtitle">May 08 - Busy Busy</span><br/>
    I was sooooo busy this month that I made no changes to my site. Sorry :(</p>
	
    <p class="backtext"><br/><span class="subtitle">Apr 08 - Approaching the end</span><br/>
    April has been a slow month cause I've been preparing for the end of my degree. ALMOST THERE! :D</p>
	
    <p class="backtext"><br/><span class="subtitle">Mar 08 - Nothing</span><br/>
    Erm... I've done nothing this month. But those of you who own a Wii might find this funny.

    <p class="backtext"><br/><span class="subtitle">Feb 08 - PHP Website</span><br/>
    My site is now using PHP and so is a lot more manageable. YAY :D</p>
	
    <p class="backtext"><br/><span class="subtitle">Jan 08 - Recomendations</span><br/>
    I finally got around to making my recomendations page and have also made my web-site more PDA-friendly.</p>
	
    <p class="backtext"><br/><span class="subtitle">Dec 07 - Quiet</span><br/>
    Nothing to report from December except a few updates to the TweakXP page</p>
	
    <p class="backtext"><br/><span class="subtitle">Nov 07 - Windows 98</span><br/>
    I've just been tinkering with an old Windows 98 machine and found that we had lost our product key. While looking online for a way to recover the product key I cam across something quite interesting.
    Since Windows 98 is now unsupported, Microsoft revealed <a href="http://help.wugnet.com/windows2/Generic-Windows-98-Product-Key-ftopict490835.html" onclick="target='_blank'" onkeypress="target='_blank'">the generic product key for Windows 98</a>! In case this link breaks in the future the key is:</p>

    <p class="backtext"><br/><span class="subtitle">Oct 07 - Portable Calendar</span><br/>
    I found a great way of carrying round my Google Calendar! I save the .ics file to my machine. I then clear my Outlook calendar and import the data from the .ics file. I can then use the Nokia PC Suite to synchronise the calendar on my phone with my Outlook Calendar. SWEET!</p>
	
    <p class="backtext"><br/><span class="subtitle">Sept 07 - Back from placement year</span><br/>
    I thoroughly enjoyed my professional placement year with ProspectSoft Ltd in Buckinghamshire. They are such a friendly company and I will be so happy when I go back to work for them again after I graduate.</p>
    <p class="backtext">If you are working for a company who isn't as organised as they should be with their customers, then check out the company's website <a href="http://www.ProspectSoft.com"  onclick="target='_blank'" onkeypress="target='_blank'">www.ProspectSoft.com</a></p>
